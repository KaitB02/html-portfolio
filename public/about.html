<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a South African mkaing the most out of life living in London, UK for close to six years and counting.</p>

<p>I enjoy having Europe and other close neighbouring countries on my doorstep for plenty of easy travel opportunites, whether it be for warm beach getways, music festivals or a wholesome hike, getting stuck in nature.
  I also enjoy keeping fit by playing a bit of social hockey league as well as playing some tennis or bouldering/rock climbing with the boyfriend. 
  Other hobbies would include cooking and baking (you could say im a bit of a foodie) and having some downtime watching movies and TV series.
</p>

<p>I am currently employed as a Membership Co-ordinator for a membership organisation. 
  I have been in this field of work for around 6 years and feel it is time to now venture out into something new and different.
 </p>

<p>I am truly looking foward to seeing what the field of Wed Development can do for me.</p>
